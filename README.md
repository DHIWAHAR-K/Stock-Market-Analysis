# Stock Market Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing stock market data using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The Jupyter Notebook explores historical stock prices, performs statistical analysis, and visualizes trends to provide insights for investors and traders. The goal is to assist in informed decision-making regarding stock investments.

## Project Structure

- `stock_market_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, statistical exploration, and visualization.
- `stock_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with historical stock market data.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library.
